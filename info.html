                <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
                <h5>Climate change is not just "global warming." It is the climates of the world becoming more and more extreme. Climate change is here and caused by humans.</h5>
                <h5>It is caused by greenhouse gasses, things like carbon dioxide and methane. These gasses come from us burning fossil fuels, and are also made from manufacturing the various things we enjoy on a day-to-day basis.</h5>
                <h5>You've probably already heard this about a million times before, <i><b>but why should you care?</b></i></h5>

                <h3>Droughts and Fires</h3>
                <h5>Climate change is causing larger heatwaves and droughts, especially in the southwestern United States. They are predicted to get even worse in the coming years.</h5>
                <h5>These effects could have played a part in California's recent drought, and the California wildfires that have destroyed many homes, communities, and lives.</h5>

                <h3>Storms and Hurricanes</h3>
                <h5>The amount of rain certain areas get have become greatly skewed. Some areas are getting unusual amounts of rain, while others get a lot less. Storms are getting worse. </h5>
                <h5>In recent years, hurricanes have become stronger and more violent. You don't need to be a climate scientist to understand this. You only need to look at the destruction caused by the hurricanes in the eastern United States.</h5>

                <h3>Flooding</h3>
                <h5>While unusually high amounts of rain has contributed to flooding, there is something much worse that could happen due to climate change. </h5>
                <h5>Over the next several decades, the sea level could rise a few feet. While this may not seem like much, this will flood many cities, especially the coastal ones. Coastal cities hold a large portion of the population, so flooding on a global scale would be absolutely devastating.</h5>
